          I am a student currently studying CS in DIT. I plan on becoming a great engineer one day, not just in coding ability but in the ability to inspire others to learn how to program. I also want to show people just how beautiful math really is. People are
          truly afraid of even trying it because they assume that it's not for them, or it's for a certain group of people. When in reality everybody can do it! With just a little bit of practise you can get better and better until you are staring at
          equations that explanin why photons act the way they do.

          I am also a Front-end Web Developer working for <a href="https://ebcd.ie" title="eBusiness Community Development">EBCD</a>. EBCD is an amazing company. We are based out in Rathfranham. We build websites using PHP, JS, HTML5, CSS3. We also create
          and perform database management using MySQL. We also develop custom widgets/modules for clients using PHP which are then used in Opencart/Wordpress. I find that being a developer here has given me a wealth of experience and knowledge that you
          can only get from being a day-to-day developer. It has also given me a passion for learning new technologies such as Angular 2 and adopting new package managers such as <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/" title="Yarn Package manager">Yarn Package Manager</a>          (blog post pending!)

          I take pride in this last one, really I do people often forget to live their lives. People often forget that they live on a great big world filled with amazing and awe-inspiring people. But I never will because my parents were immigrants from South Africa.
          They left their homeland in search of a better future for not only themselves but me. They wanted me to have an amazing life not only academically but also philisophically. They wanted me to see that we all belong to one race, that we all lived
          on one planet and that no matter what we should never treat anybody like they are not <strong>Human</strong> because we are all Human!
